   4. Sign in via the console link found in credentials.csv
      - Use your new IAM user credentials (Created in earlier step)
        - OPTIONAL: setup custom console login link
      - Configure a new profile 
        ```
        aws configure --profile tf_demo
        ```
      - When asked for access keys, use info from credential.csv
      - Verify the profile is setup correctly with:
        1. ```cd ~/.aws```
        2. ```cat credentials```
      - Test that profile works:
        1. ```aws s3 ls --profile tf_demo```.
           - You should NOT see an error but there will be NO S3 bucket info listed.
   5. Go to your AWS console as the created new user (log in from the web).
      1. Create a new S3 bucket from the AWS console.
         - Select NEXT all the way.
         - **Give a name you can remember for your s3 bucket as you will use it in prac02**
      2. Retry ```aws s3 ls --profile tf_demo``` again.
         - You should see your bucket listed there.
